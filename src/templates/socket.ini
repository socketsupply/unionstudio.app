; The value of the "script" property in the build section will be interpreted as
; a shell command when  you run "ssc build". This is the most important command
; in this file. It will do all the heavy lifting and should handle 99.9% of your
; use cases for moving files into place or tweaking platform-specific build
; artifacts. If you don't specify it, ssc will just copy everything in your
; project to the build target.
;
; Note that "~" alias won't expand to the home directory in any of the config
; files. Use the full path instead.
